          <h1 id="what">What is a rubberocket?</h1>
          <p>Rubberocket is this nifty little early 2000s minimalistic-looking site where I put up all my things and you have to sit here and deal with it.</p>
        <p>My name's Aleph Diallo, and I'm an aspiring artist and animator, just doing my thing. I also, as you can see, make websites with my sub-par knowledge of HTML + JavaScript and, <strong><em>in this case</em></strong>, my pre-owned copy of Macromedia Studio 8.</p>
          <p>This site is almost always in a state of unfinishedness, as all sites are. However, this site, as of 2024/08/30, is as unfinished as any of the web series ideas that have never come into fruition. As time passes by, this will be less unfinished. I promise I will not change design  until I get <em>really</em> bored with it .</p>
          <h1 id="contact">Where can I contact you?</h1>
          <p>I'd prefer you to contact me via email:</p>
          <p>aleph@rubberocket.com</p>
          <h1>Why is this site designed the way it is?</h1>
          <p>I've always been more fascinated by earlier websites, specifically those from the early 2000s. I will admit that this has influenced my web design aspects by a long shot, but it's good to implement modern stuff, too. </p>
          <p>One good example of this &quot;modern stuff&quot; is with the blur filter combined with some CSS transitions. Try doing <em>that</em> in the 2000s <em>without</em> Flash!</p>
          <h1 id="noold">Why can't I view this is in my old web browser?</h1>
          <p>This site doesn't support browsers without some sort of actual TLS support, or at the very least operating systems that don't have the specific certificates needed to view this site. Sorry! </p>
          <h1 id="past">What has this site looked like in the past?</h1>
          <p>Let's find out with the following links! </p>
