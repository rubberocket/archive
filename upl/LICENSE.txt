                         UNTITLED PUBLIC LICENSE
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

1. This can't be used on software. If you really want something similar 
for that purpose, try the GNU General Public License, the MIT license, 
or the BSD license.

2. Once a work is licensed under the UPL, it can still be copyrighted,
but people can do whatever they want as long as they credit the original
author. If the original work is derivative, credit who they credited, too.

3. The only limit is that, if the creator does not wish for people to 
monetize their derivative works, then you may not profit off of your 
derivative. This also applies to people using your derivative.

4. This is a share-alike license. Your derivative must also be licensed 
under the UPL.
