          <h1>untitled public license.</h1>
          <p>License for creative works created in 5 minutes.</p>
          <h2>So, how does this stuff work?</h2>
          <p>The Untitled Public License means that a work is still copyrighted, yes, but said work can be remixed and copied to one's liking, as long as they credit the original source.</p>
          <p>For instance, if you were to remix, say, Steamboat Willie (let's just pretend that it was made last Tuesday and it was licensed under the UPL), you'd credit Walt Disney, as he made the work. </p>
          <h2>Can I profit off a work licensed under the UPL?</h2>
          <p>As long as it's yours, or the original creator allows you to if your work is a remix, yes you can.</p>
          <h2>Can I use this license against someone and make fun of their work?</h2>
          <p>Yes. If this weren't the case the U.P.L. would just be plain old &copy;opyright.</p>
          <h2>Can this be used on software?</h2>
          <p>No. If you need something similar, I'd recommend the GPL if you don't want people profiting off their forks. If you do want people to profit off their forks, try the <a href="https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause" target="_blank">BSD</a> or <a href="https://opensource.org/license/mit" target="_blank">MIT</a> licenses.</p>
          <h2><a href="LICENSE.txt" target="_blank">the license:</a></h2>
          <p>
            <pre>                         UNTITLED PUBLIC LICENSE
                        Version 1.2, November 2024

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified 
copies of this license document, and changing it is allowed as long 
as the name is changed.

                         UNTITLED PUBLIC LICENSE
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

1. This can't be used on software. If you really want something similar 
for that purpose, try the GNU General Public License, the MIT license, 
or the BSD license.

2. Once a work is licensed under the UPL, it can still be copyrighted,
but people can do whatever they want as long as they credit the original
author. If the original work is derivative, credit who they credited, too.

3. The only limit is that, if the creator does not wish for people to 
monetize their derivative works, then you may not profit off of your 
derivative. This also applies to people using your derivative.

4. This is a share-alike license. Your derivative must also be licensed 
under the UPL.
